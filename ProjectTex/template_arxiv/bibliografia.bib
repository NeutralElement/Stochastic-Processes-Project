abstract = {Abstract The design of distribution networks that simultaneously consider location and inventory decisions seeks to balance costs and product availability. The most commonly observed measure of product availability in practical settings is the fill-rate service level. However, the optimal design of a distribution network that considers the fill rate to control shortages of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) is considered intractable and has only been addressed by heuristic methods. This paper addresses the optimal design of a distribution network for FMCG able to provide high fill-rate service level under a continuous review (r,Q)\$(r,Q)\$ policy. Considering the exact formulation for the provided fill rate, we formulated a joint location–inventory model with fill-rate service level constraints as a convex mixed integer nonlinear problem for which a novel decomposition-based outer approximation algorithm is proposed. Numerical experiments have shown that our solution approach provides good-quality solutions that are on average 0.15\% and, at worst, 2.2\% from the optimal solution.},

abstract = {A patrolling strategy that defines fare inspection frequencies on a proof-of-payment transportation system is operationally useful to the transit authority when there is a mechanism for its practical implementation. This study addresses the operational implementation of a fare inspection patrolling strategy under an in-station selective inspection policy using an unpredictable patrolling schedule, where the transit authority select a patrolling schedule each day with some probability. The challenge is to determine the set of patrolling schedules and their respective probabilities of being selected whose systematic day-to-day application matches the inspection frequencies that inhibit the action of opportunistic passengers in the medium term. A Stackelberg game approach is used to represent the hierarchical decision making process between the transit authority and opportunistic passengers. The heterogeneity of opportunistic passengers’ decisions to evade fare payment is taken into account. Numerical experiments show that a joint strategy-schedule approach provides good-quality unpredictable patrolling schedules with respect to the optimality gap for large-scale networks.},

abstract = {This study analyzes the scheduling of unpredictable fare inspections in proof-of-payment transit systems, where the transit operator chooses a collection of patrol paths (one for each patrol) every day with some probability in order to avoid any regularity that could be exploited by opportunistic passengers. We use a Stackelberg game approach to represent the hierarchical decision-making process between the transit operator and opportunistic passengers, whose decision on whether to evade the fare depends on the inspection probabilities set by the transit operator. Unlike previous work, we use an exact formulation of the inspection probabilities that allows us to develop new heuristics for the fare inspection scheduling problem, and to assess their solution quality in terms of their optimality gap.}
